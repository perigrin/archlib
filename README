NAME
    archlib - Add tar archive to @INC path

SYNOPSIS
        use archlib 'path/to/archive1.tar.gz';
        use archlib 'path/to/archive2.tar.bz2';
        use archlib 'path/to/archive3.zip';

        use Module::In::Archive1;
        use Module::In::Archive2;
        use Module::In::Archive3;

        ...

ARCHIVE SPECIFICATIONS
    The root of the archive is the root of the search path, ie:

        archive1.tar.bz2:
         TopLevel.pm
         My/Module.pm
         DeeperPath/To/Module.pm

    You must NOT put everything into a 'lib' directory.

UNDER THE HOOD
    This module will unshift a subroutine into @INC. This routine will
    iterate all archives that have been added looking for each module
    loaded. If the module is not present in any archive other @INC entries
    will be checked. The module maintains a package variable containing the
    list of archives.

ARCHIVE MANAGEMENT
  TAR.*
    Will try the following in order, you may also specify your own list in
    the $ENV{ARCHLIB_TAR_ORDER} environment variable.

    Archive::Peek::Libarchive
    Archive::Peek::External
    Archive::Tar

  ZIP
    Uses Archive::Zip if it is installed, otherwise it will ask you to
    install it in an error message.
